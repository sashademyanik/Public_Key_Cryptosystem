Description: This is a public key cryptosystem that will prompt the user for a random
	number and see a random number generator to create public and private keys.
	The program will encrypt the plaintext in 32 bit blocks using the public key
	and decrypt the ciphertext using the private key.
	
How to Build: 
	- Load Eclipse IDE
	- Press File, then Import
	- Select Git, then Projects from Git
	- Click local
	- Add the git repository from where ever the project is located
	- Import Existing projects and click next
	- Click finish and the project should be imported
	- Click run and type in the corresponding letters to perform the correct actions
		Enter in 'K' for key generation, 'E' for encryption, 'D' for decryption and
		'C' to close
	- Add a ptext.txt in the src folder of the project to ensure the program runs.

Files:
	* .git folder - holders the git repository of the project
	* Cryptosystem java project - holds all files in the project
	* README.txt - Descriptions of the program
